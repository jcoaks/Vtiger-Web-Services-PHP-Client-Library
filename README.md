# Installation

The recommended way to install vtwsphpclib is with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP.

Specify vtwsphpclib as a dependency in your **composer.json** file:

	{
   		"require": {
      		"jcoaks/vtiger": "0.1"
   		}
	}

In case you are new to Composer, you need to include the file `/vendor/autoload.php` file.

# Usage

## Creating the WSClient object
	use Jcoaks\Vtiger\WSClient;

	$url = 'http://example.com/';

	$config = [
		'auth' => [
			'username' => 'YOURVTIGERUSERNAME',
			'accesskey' => 'YOURVTIGERACCESSKEY'
		]
	];

	$wsclient = new WSClient($url, $config);

## Retrieving Errors

If an operation fails, the return value will be false. No error will be displayed unless you call

	echo $wsclient->getLastError();

## Create Object

	$create = $wsclient->createObject('Accounts', array('accountname' => 'Test account'));

## List Types

Get a list of Vtiger objects that are available when using the API.

	$availableModules = $wsclient->getAvailableModules();
